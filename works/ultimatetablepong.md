As our Computer Graphics class project in 2nd year; we were asked to do a basic scene with few intractable objects as our term project. 

But we didn't want to do a "basic project". We asked if we could make a game instead and the reply was: 

"Yes, that would be great actually."

So, our game was born. We merged two millennias-old concepts: 

Explosions and Pong!
