## Experience

### Specialist (Computer Engineer - System Administrator)
### Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey


**Dec 2019 – Present (3 yr 6 mos)**
#### Keywords: #automation #servers #ansible #infrastructure #python #linux

As a system administrator I have worked with virtualized systems consisting of mainly RHEL and Windows Server VMs running on VMware alongside tools like Ansible, Terraform, Satellite etc. I have worked with critical systems that require 100% uptime.

My main project was Infrastructure Automation. I took initiative and pushed for automation, then led the efforts to introduce automation to our systems. During our evaluations I had the chance to work with Terraform, Saltstack, Cloudforms and contemporaries. I integrated AWX (upstream ansible tower) running on Kubernetes to our infrastructure as a proof of concept, then made all of our provision, configuration, patching, management jobs run on Ansible Automation Platform scheduled and hands-free.

Similar to automation, I've reached beyond my job duties and created a Server Inventory App using Python, Django and SQLite; which synchronizes data from VMware vCenter, Active Directory, Ansible Automation Platform, Tenable, our local databases and mail servers. It quickly grew beyond it's original purposes and became a central hub for us to monitor, list and report everything related to our infrastructure. 

Later on I've rewrote the app on Flask and moved the database to PostgreSQL while also writing an API.

In addition to these projects, I regularly wrote Powershell and Bash scripts, configured RHEL and Windows Servers. Gained proficiency in Linux servers and worked with Docker/Kubernetes.
