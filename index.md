## Experience

### Assistant Specialist
### Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey


**Dec 2019 – Present (1 yr 8 mos)**
#### Keywords: #automation #servers #ansible #infrastructure #python #linux

As a system administrator I have worked with virtualized systems consisting of mainly RHEL and Windows Server VMs running on VMware alongside the automation tools like Ansible, Satellite, AWX. 
I regularly wrote PowerShell and Bash scripts for multiple tasks.

During our automation evaluations I also had the chance to work with Terraform, SaltStack and contemporaries.

Using Python I have created an Server Inventory App; which synchronizes data from vCenter, Active Directory, our local databases and mail servers, thus enabling us to monitor & manage our server inventory while keeping it automatically updated and alerting related users if needed. Completed with advanced reporting features, it evolved from a side project to a critical app for multiple departments. In addition to my administration tasks, I've maintained and developed the inventory app for wider use.
